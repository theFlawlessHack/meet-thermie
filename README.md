# meet-thermie

<b>Bonjour.</b>Meet Thermie.<br>
A thermie is a unit of hear energy.<br>
In my case, Thermie is a smart home project designed to optimize my home's analog thermostat.<br>
<br>
#### why?
Why would I do this when there are already smart thermostats like Nest and Honeywell?<br>
1. I live with my parents and an analog thermostat is easier for them (turn a knob)<br>
2. I'm frugal and own arduinos
