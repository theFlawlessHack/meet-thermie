# meet-thermie

<b>Bonjour.</b> Meet Thermie.<br>
A thermie is a unit of hear energy.<br>
In my case, <b>Thermie</b> is a smart home project designed to optimize my home's analog thermostat.<br>
<br>
### why?
Why would I do this when there are already smart thermostats?<br>
1. I live with my parents and an analog thermostat is easier for them (turn a knob)<br>
2. It's a fun experiment
## partitions
There are two partitions to Thermie, the iOS app and the arduino hardware.
